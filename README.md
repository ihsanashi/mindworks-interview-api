## Introduction

This is part of a technical assessment I had gone through for a Frontend Developer position with Mindworks Interactive, a digital agency in Malaysia. This backend application was built with Express, Apollo Server and GraphQL. The dataset is provided by [{JSON} Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).

## Technologies

- Express for the backend framework
- Apollo Server for the GraphQL server
- GraphQL as the query language for this API
- Heroku for the deployment platform
